# Temperature / Pressure effects on viscosity and surface tension (assume P: 2 [MPa], T: 15 [c])
#   Viscosity (μ) increases slightly (~5-10%) → Slower fluid movement, affects flow through valves/nozzles.
#   Surface tension (σ) increases slightly (~2-3%) → Affects droplet formation, wicking, and tank wetting behavior.
#   Pressure effect is minimal, but temperature is more significant at 15°C.
